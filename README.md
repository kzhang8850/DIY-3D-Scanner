# DIY-3D-Scanner

We created a 3D scanner that could use an IR sensor to measure distances to its surroundings in virtually all directions and then plot them to generate a 3D visualization of the scanned area. The IR sensor was mounted onto a pan-tilt mechanism with two servos, and data flow passed from Arduino bootloader for collection to Python for processing to MATLAB for plotting. The scanner's success was demonstrated through a visualization of a letter made out of cardboard cutouts.
